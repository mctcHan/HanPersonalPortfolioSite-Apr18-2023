- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Han@mctcHan
- Iâ€™m interested in photography.
- Iâ€™m currently learning javaScript.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Font_End Development.

As a front-end developer, I see myself as a creative problem solver who uses code to bring ideas to life. I am passionate about user experience and strive to create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that blend form and function seamlessly. My unique perspective comes from my understanding of graphic design and my love of photography, which enables me to approach development with an eye for aesthetics and strong attention to detail. I constantly seek to learn and grow, staying updated with the latest technologies and design trends. Front-end development is not just a job. It's a craft that allows me to express my creativity and positively impact people's lives.
