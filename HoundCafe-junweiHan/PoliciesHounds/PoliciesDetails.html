    <h1 class="text-center mt-5">Policies of Hounds Cafe</h1>
    <p class="my-4">

      The HOunds Cafe was formed principally for the protection and advancement of pure-bred dogs.
      The State of New York by Special Act of its Legislature incorporated The American Kennel Club and granted it a charter in Section 2 of which the objects of the corporation are described to be “to adopt and enforce uniform rules regulating and governing dog shows and field trials, to regulate the conduct of persons interested in exhibiting, running, breeding, registering, purchasing and selling dogs, to detect, prevent and punish frauds in connection therewith, to protect the interests of its members, to maintain and publish an official stud book and an official kennel gazette, and generally to do everything to advance the study, breeding, exhibiting, running and maintenance of the purity of thoroughbred dogs.”
      Section 2 of this charter further states that “for these purposes it,” The American Kennel Club, “shall have power to adopt a constitution, bylaws, rules and regulations, and enforce the same by fines and penalties, which it shall have the right to collect and enforce by suit, or by suspension or expulsion from membership, or by a suspension or denial of any or all of the privileges of said corporation.”
      Competition in conformation and performance events can best demonstrate the progress that has been made in breeding for type and quality, and/or for practical use, stamina and obedience. The American Kennel Club has therefore adopted bylaws, rules and regulations by which to govern and administrate these events; the clubs that wish to hold them; and the individuals who exhibit, compete or take part in them. This book contains such bylaws, rules and regulations as affect the above.

      FIELD TRIAL RULES FOR BASSET HOUNDS
      
      CHAPTER 1 GENERAL EXPLANATIONS
      SECTION 1 . The words “Hound” wherever used in these Field Trial Rules and Regulations includes both sexes of the Basset Hound breed.
      SECTION 2 . The words “United States of America” wherever used in these Rules and Regulations shall be construed to include all territories and possessions of the United States of America and all vessels sailing under the American flag.
      
      CHAPTER 2 FIELD TRIALS DEFINED
      SECTION 1 . A MEMBER FIELD TRIAL is a field
      trial at which championship points may be awarded, held by a club which is a member of The American Kennel Club.
      SECTION 2 . A LICENSED FIELD TRIAL is a field
      trial at which championship points may be awarded, held by a club which is not a member of The American Kennel Club but which has been licensed by The American Kennel Club to hold the specific field trial designated in the license.
      SECTION 3 .  A SANCTIONED FIELD TRIAL is
      a field trial at which Hounds may compete but not for championship points, held by a club, whether or not a member of The American Kennel Club or by a Basset Hound Association, by obtaining the sanction of The American Kennel Club.
      
      CHAPTER 3 MAKING APPLICATION TO
      HOLD A FIELD TRIAL
      SECTION 1 .  A club which wishes to hold a licensed or member field trial must apply to The American Kennel Club on a form which will be supplied on request to clubs that meet the requirements of The American Kennel Club. This application will be referred to the Board of Directors of The American Kennel Club which will consider it and notify the club of its approval or disapproval.
      A licensed or member club is allowed to hold up to four field trials per calendar year.
      SECTION 2 . A non-member club shall submit with its application a check or money order in payment of the license fee, the amount of which shall be fixed and determined by the Board of Directors of The American Kennel Club. If the Board of Directors shall disapprove the application, the license fee will be returned to the
       
      club. [At present the license fee for a Basset Hound Field Trial is $35.00.]
      SECTION 3 . A non-member specialty club may be licensed to hold a field trial, if the consent in writing that it may be given first shall be obtained from the member specialty club, formed for the improvement of the breed sought to be run, which first was admitted to be a member of The American Kennel Club, which member club is commonly known as the Parent Club.
      If a Parent Club unreasonably shall withhold its consent in writing to the holding of such field trial the non-member specialty club may appeal to the Board of Directors of The American Kennel Club at any time after one month from the time when said consent was requested and a committee of said Board appointed by said Board, or between sittings of said Board, appointed by the President of The American Kennel Club, or in his absence by the Executive Vice- President of The American Kennel Club, shall hear the parties who may present their respective contentions, either orally or in writing, and in its discretion may issue a license to the non-member specialty club to hold such field trial.
      SECTION 4 . Advertising . Clubs may only advertise corresponding dates, locations and stakes, plus club contact information, prior to an event receiving AKC® approval. Clubs may not advertise an event prior to AKC approval if the dates or location differ from the previous year’s corresponding event. Premium lists cannot be made available nor can entries be accepted until the event and judges panel has been approved by the AKC.
      SECTION 5 .  A member or non-member club or Basset Hound Association which wishes to hold a sanctioned field trial must apply to The American Kennel Club on a form, which will be supplied upon request. An application for a sanctioned Basset Hound field trial will be referred to the Board of Directors of The American Kennel Club which will consider it and notify the club or association of its approval or disapproval. No fee is required to be paid for approval of an application for a sanctioned field trial.
      SECTION 6 . All of these Rules and Procedures shall apply to sanctioned field trials as well as to licensed or member field trials, except for those Rules and Procedures that state specifically that they apply to licensed or member trials only. Such Rules will not apply to Plan B sanctioned trials unless the club specifies in the announcement for the event that the particular Rule or Procedure will apply.
      SECTION 7 . The use of a club’s name for field trial purposes cannot be transferred.
       
      CHAPTER 4 RIBBONS, MONEY PRIZES, AND
      SPECIAL PRIZES
      SECTION 1 . A club holding a licensed or member field trial shall offer prize ribbons or rosettes of the following colors in the four regular classes:
      First prize - Blue Second prize - Red Third prize - Yellow Fourth prize - White
      N.B.Q. - Dark Green
      For additional non-regular classes, a club holding a licensed or member trial shall offer ribbons or rosettes of the following colors:
      First prize - Rose Second prize - Brown
      Third prize - Light Green Fourth prize - Gray
      N.B.Q. - Orange
      SECTION 2 . Each ribbon or rosette at a licensed or member field trial shall be at least 2 inches wide and approximately 8 inches long and shall bear on its face a facsimile of the seal of The American Kennel Club, the words Field Trial, the name of the prize, the name of the field trial-giving club, and the date of the trial.
      SECTION 3 . If ribbons or rosettes are given at sanctioned field trials they shall be of the following colors, and shall bear the words Field Trial, but may be of any design or size:
      First prize - Rose Second prize - Brown
      Third prize - Light Green Fourth prize - Gray
      N.B.Q. - Orange
      SECTION 4 . If money prizes are offered, a fixed amount or percentage of the entry fee for each prize shall be stated.
      SECTION 5 . All special prizes, not money, which may be offered shall be accurately described or the value stated. Stud services shall not be accepted as special prizes.
       
      CHAPTER 5
      JUDGES AND THEIR DECISIONS
      SECTION 1 . Persons judging field trials are not required to obtain licenses and a field trial club may submit the name of any reputable person who is in good standing with The American Kennel Club for approval to judge at its field trial. Such approved Judges may run Hounds in any classes which they are not judging and for which they are not advertised as Judges.
      No person under 18 years of age will be approved to be advertised as a Judge of a licensed or member trial.
      No officer of a club, or any member of the Field Trial Committee, or the Field Trial Secretary, will be approved to be advertised as a Judge of the club’s licensed or member trial.
      SECTION 2 . Substitute Judges shall be appointed by the club holding a trial if it is impossible for any advertised Judges to fulfill or complete their assignments. Additional Judges shall be appointed by the Field Trial Committee when required under the Standard Procedure and may be appointed if unforeseen circumstances would otherwise prevent completion of the trial during the days advertised in the premium list. Such substitute and additional Judges shall be persons who are in good standing with The American Kennel Club. When such Judges are used, they should, if possible, act in conjunction with one or more of the advertised Judges, provided this does not prevent an advertised Judge from completing the judging of a class which he has already started. If two such Judges have to judge together without one of the advertised Judges, at least one should be an experienced Judge of licensed or member Basset Hound or Beagle field trials. The American Kennel Club shall be notified promptly of the reasons for appointing substitute or additional judges.
      SECTION 3 . Before any advertised Judge shall be eligible to judge a licensed or member field trial, the Judge shall first sign an agreement certifying that he/she has a thorough knowledge of the rules, regulations and procedures, and will judge in strict accord with them.
      SECTION 4 . DQ by Judge. A dog is not eligible to be entered or to compete in any licensed or member trial if the dog has on two occasions been made the subject of the following report: If a dog, while under judgment, attacks another dog, and if the Judges are unanimously of the opinion that such attack was without reasonable cause, the Judges shall identify
       
      the offending dog on the judging sheet, and the name of the offending dog shall be listed in the report of the trial sent to The American Kennel Club.
      SECTION 5 . The decisions of the Judges shall be final in all matters relating to the merits of the Hounds.
      CHAPTER 6
      FIELD TRIAL COMMITTEE, FIELD TRIAL SECRETARY, PREMIUM LISTS
      SECTION 1 . A club or Basset Hound Association that has been granted permission by The American Kennel Club to hold a field trial must appoint a Field Trial Committee which shall have charge of the organization and management of the trial. The committee shall have at least five members, one of whom shall be designated Field Trial Committee Chairman. The committee may include the Field Trial Secretary, but the Field Trial Secretary shall not be designated Field Trial Committee Chairman.
      SECTION 2 . A club that has been granted permission by The American Kennel Club to hold a licensed or member field trial must appoint a Field Trial Secretary acceptable to The American Kennel Club whose name and address must be submitted to The American Kennel Club before the premium list for the trial can be printed. Any reputable person who is in good standing with the American Kennel Club may act as Field Trial Secretary.
      SECTION 3 . The Field Trial Committee and Field Trial Secretary shall be held responsible for compliance with the Basset Hound Field Trial Rules and Procedures and must provide themselves with copies of the latest edition of this book.
      SECTION 4 . A club that has been granted permission by The American Kennel Club to hold a licensed or member field trial, before its premium list and entry forms shall be printed, must send to The American Kennel Club for approval one copy of a questionnaire form supplied by The American Kennel Club which will specify the exact location of the grounds where the trial is to be run; whether the trial will be run in braces, small packs, or large packs; the classes to be run and their conditions; the place where the drawing or numbering will be done and the time entries close for each class; the date each class is to start; the names and city/state addresses of the Judges and the classes which each is to judge; a complete list of money, ribbon prizes and special prizes which the club wishes to offer;
       
      the entry fee; the names and city/state addresses of the officers of the club: the mailing address of the Field Trial Secretary; the name and city/state address of the chairman and the names of the other members of the Field Trial Committee. The premium list for each licensed or member field trial shall contain all of the information set forth on the official AKC Event Application form as approved by The American Kennel Club, except the addresses for the judges, trial chair and club officers need only include the city/state. The premium list shall be of official size.
      SECTION 5 . Every premium list for a licensed or member field trial shall contain one or more copies of the official American Kennel Club® entry form, samples of which will be supplied on request.
      SECTION 6 . Field Trial Committees may make such regulations or additional rules for the government of their field trials as shall be considered necessary, provided such regulations or additional rules do not conflict with any rule or procedure of The American Kennel Club. Such regulations or additional rules shall be printed in the premium list of a licensed or member field trial and violations thereof shall be considered the same as violations of the Rules and Regulations of The American Kennel Club.
      SECTION 7 .  When a dog is seriously injured or dies in connection with an event, the Event Committee must conduct a preliminary investigation to determine if negligence or the willful conduct of an individual caused the injury or death. If the preliminary investigation determines that there was no negligence or willful conduct causing the injury or death, then a written report of the findings of the preliminary investigation must be submitted to the AKC (Attn: Executive Secretary), 101 Park Avenue, Fifth Floor, New York, NY 10178 within five (5) days. If the Event Committee determines that negligence or willful conduct may have caused the death or serious injury, the Event Committee must hold an Event Hearing.
      
      CHAPTER 7
      ENTRY REQUIREMENTS AND ELIGIBILITY
      SECTION 1 . Basset Hound Field Trials shall be open to dogs six months of age or over on the first day of the event.
      SECTION 2 . No Basset Hound shall be eligible to be entered in a licensed or member field trial unless it is either individually registered with the AKC or individually registered with a foreign or domestic registry organization whose pedigrees are acceptable for American Kennel Club registration.
       
      A Hound with an AKC Limited Registration shall be eligible for entry in licensed or Member Club Field Trials. Spayed and neutered dogs are eligible to compete (See Procedure 2-B).
      A Hound that is individually registered with a foreign or domestic registry organization whose pedigrees are acceptable for AKC registration may, without special AKC approval, be entered in licensed or member field trials that are held not later than thirty (30) days after the first licensed or member field trial in which the Hound was entered, but only provided that the individual foreign registration number and the name of the country of birth are shown on the entry form, and provided further than the same name, which in the case of an imported Hound must be the name on the foreign registration, is used for the Hound each time.
      SECTION 3 . No individually registered Hound with a foreign or domestic registry organization that has not been individually registered with The American Kennel Club when first entered in a licensed or member field trial shall be eligible to be entered in any licensed or member field trial class that is started more than thirty
      (30) days after the first entry in a licensed or member field trial, unless the owner has received from The American Kennel Club an extension notice authoriz- ing further entries of the Hound for a specified period of time with its foreign registration number. No such extension will be granted unless the owner can clearly demonstrate, in a letter addressed to the Performance Events Department of The American Kennel Club requesting such extension, that the delay in registration of the Hound is due to circumstances for which he is not responsible. Any such extension notice will be void upon registration of the Hound or upon expiration of the period for which extension has been granted, but upon application, further extensions may be granted.
      SECTION 4 . Each entry in a licensed or member field trial must be made on an official American Kennel Club entry form. Each entry form must be completed in full and must be signed by the owner or his agent duly authorized to make the entry and the information given on the form must be that which applies to the entered Hound.
      SECTION 5 . Every Hound must be entered in the name of the person who actually owned the Hound at the time entries closed. The right to enter and run a Hound cannot be transferred. A registered Hound which has been acquired by some person other than the owner as recorded with The American Kennel Club must be entered in the name of its new owner
       
      at any field trial for which entries close after the date on which the Hound was acquired and application for transfer of ownership must be sent to The American Kennel Club by the new owner within seven days after the last day of the trial. The new owner should state on the entry form that the transfer application has been mailed to The American Kennel Club or will be mailed shortly. If there is any unavoidable delay in obtaining the completed application required to record the trans- fer, The American Kennel Club may grant a reasonable extension of time provided the new owner notifies the Performance Events Department of The American Kennel Club by mail, within seven (7) days after the trial, of the reason for the delay. If an entry is made by a duly authorized agent of the owner, the name of the actual owner must be shown on the entry form.
      SECTION 6 . Owners are responsible for errors made on entry forms regardless of who may have made such errors.
      SECTION 7 . No entry shall be accepted from any person who stands suspended from the privileges of The American Kennel Club.
      SECTION 8 . No entry shall be made under a ken- nel name unless that name has been registered with The American Kennel Club. All entries made under a kennel name must be signed with the kennel name followed by the word “registered.” An “entrant” is the individual, or if a partnership, all the members of the partnership, entering a field trial. In the case of such entry by a partnership every member of the partner- ship shall be in good standing with The American Kennel Club before the entry will be accepted and, in case of any infraction of these rules, all the partners shall be held equally responsible.
      SECTION 9 . No Hound shall be eligible to com- pete at any field trial, no Hound shall be brought into the grounds or premises of any field trial and any Hound which may have been brought into the grounds or premises of a field trial shall immediately be removed, if it
      (a)	shows clinical symptoms of distemper, infectious hepatitis, leptospirosis or other communicable disease, or
      (b)	is known to have been in contact with distemper, infectious hepatitis, leptospirosis or other communi- cable disease within thirty days prior to the opening of the trial, or
      (c)	has been kenneled within thirty (30) days prior to the opening of the trial on premises on which there existed distemper, infectious hepatitis, leptospirosis or other communicable disease.
       
      SECTION 10 . A Hound is not eligible to be entered or to compete in any field trial in any class if an advertised or actual Judge of that class or any member of his/her immediate family or household has owned, sold, held under lease, boarded, trained, or handled the Hound within one year prior to the date of the field trial. Immediate family means husband, wife, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or sister. Transporting a Hound is not considered handling.
      SECTION 11 . A field trial-giving club shall not accept an entry fee other than that published in its premium list or entry form, or in any way discriminate between entrants. No club or member of any club shall give or offer to give any owner or handler any special inducements, such as reduced entry fees, rebates, allowances for expenses or other incentive of value for a certain number of entries. Except a club, at its discretion, may allow for a reduced entry fee for dogs handled by juniors. The reduced entry fee may only apply to specific stakes or may apply to any stake in the trial. The reduced entry fee shall be published in the premium list. A junior is defined as someone less than 18 years of age on the first day of the event. The junior must handle the dog in the event to qualify for the reduced entry fee. If the dog is entered under this provision but the junior does not handle the dog, the owner must pay the regular entry fee as published.
      SECTION 12 . “Just Cause” Rule . A Field Trial Committee may decline any entries or may remove any Hound from its trial for cause, but in each such instance shall notify the Performance Events Department in a timely manner regarding the good and sufficient reasons for its actions.
      SECTION 13 . Hounds Must Compete . Any Hound entered and present at a field trial must compete in any class in which it is entered unless it is disqualified or marked absent by the Judges, or is found to be ineligible or is excused by the Field Trial Committee after consultation with the Judges.
      SECTION 14 . DQ by Event Committee . Any dog, that in the opinion of the Event Committee or The American Kennel Club, attacks a person or a dog at an AKC event, resulting in injury, and is believed by that Event Committee or The American Kennel Club to present a hazard to persons or other dogs shall be disqualified. When the dog is disqualified by the Event Committee pursuant to this section, a report shall be filed immediately with the Executive Secretary of The American Kennel Club. The disqualified dog may not again compete at any AKC event nor be on the grounds of an AKC event unless and until, following application for reinstatement
       
      by the owner to The American Kennel Club, the owner receives official notification in writing from the AKC that the dog’s eligibility has been reinstated.
      CHAPTER 8 CANCELLATIONS AND PROTESTS
      AGAINST HOUNDS
      SECTION 1 . If at a licensed or member trial an ineligible Hound has been entered in any class, or if a Hound has been entered in the name of an owner other than the actual owner at the time entries closed, or if a Hound has been run in a class for which it was not entered, or if its entry form is deemed invalid by The American Kennel Club under these rules, any resulting awards shall be canceled by The American Kennel Club and such Hound shall not be counted as a starter in determining championship ratings.
      SECTION 2 . If the win of a Hound at a licensed or member trial is canceled, the Hound next in order of merit shall be moved up, if eligible, and the win of the Hound moved up shall be counted the same as if it had been the original award.
      SECTION 3 . If the win of a Hound is canceled by The American Kennel Club, the owner of the Hound shall return all prizes for such win to the Secretary of the field trial–giving club within ten (10) days of receipt of notice from The American Kennel Club of said cancellation.
      SECTION 4 .  Protesting a Dog’s Eligibility . Any person who is a member of a member club of The American Kennel Club, or who owns a Hound entered in the field trial, or who handles a Hound competing in the trial, may make a protest to the Field Trial Committee against any Hound competing in the trial, either before or after the Hound has been judged, alleging that under these Rules and Procedures it is ineligible to compete in the trial or in the class in which it is entered, or that it must be disqualified. Such a protest shall be in writing, shall identify the Hound protested and specify the basis for the protest, shall bear the signature and address of the person who makes it, and shall describe his qualifications for making the protest. It shall be filed with the Field Trial Secretary or with the Chairman of the Field Trial Committee before the closing of the trial, and shall be accompanied by a deposit of ten dollars ($10.00), which shall be returned if the protest is sustained or which will be retained by the club if the protest if not sustained.
      SECTION 5 . If such a written protest is received, the Field Trial Committee shall hold a meeting as soon as possible. In order to ensure impartiality, no person
       
      that owns or co-owns the dog being protested or any member of the owners household, no professional trainer that has trained or handled the dog within the past year, and no owner or handler of a dog who may benefit as a result of the Committee’s decision may serve on the Committee hearing the protest. The Committee may vote to excuse anyone from the Committee if there are unique situations that cause the Committee to question an individual’s ability to be impartial. The person who has made the protest must be present and the Committee shall give all parties concerned an opportunity to be heard and to present witnesses and evidence. The Committee may call for additional evidence from other qualified persons present at the trial. After hearing all of the evidence, the Field Trial Committee shall consider the matter and shall, if possible, reach an immediate decision and inform the persons involved.
      A report of the meeting, giving all of the essential evidence and the Committee’s decision, together with the original written protest must be mailed to The American Kennel Club within seven (7) days of the trial.
      SECTION 6 . An appeal to The American Kennel Club from a decision of a Field Trial Committee on any such protest may be made by either the owner of the Hound protested or the person who made the protest. The appeal must be received by The American Kennel Club Performance Events Department within thirty
      (30) days after the date of the Field Trial Committee’s decision and must be accompanied by a deposit of fifty dollars ($50.00), which shall be forfeited if the decision is sustained.
      
      CHAPTER 9 DESCRIPTION OF CLASSES AND CHAMPIONSHIP REQUIREMENTS
      SECTION 1 . All licensed and member Basset Hound Field Trials shall be run under one of the three following procedures:
      A.	Braces on Rabbit or Hare.
      B.	Small Packs on Rabbit or Hare.
      C.	Large Packs on Hare.
      SECTION 2 . At a licensed or member Basset Hound Field Trial the following regular classes may be offered: Open All-Age Dogs and Open All-Age Bitches. If however, when entries are closed there are less than six (6) entries in one of the classes, the class shall be combined if possible and run with both sexes in a single class.
      SECTION 3 .  Additional non-regular classes may
       
      be run if specified and if the conditions of each such class are described in the premium list.
      A Derby Class is a non-regular class and shall be for Basset Hounds which have not reached their second birthday on the day the class is scheduled. For example, a Basset Hound whelped May 1, 1991, would not be eligible for a Derby Class scheduled for May 1, 1993, but would be eligible for a class scheduled for April 30, 1993.
      A Champion Class is a non-regular class and shall be for Basset Hounds that have completed the requirements for Field Champions per Chapter 9; Section 6.
      SECTION 4 . Splitting of prizes or places is prohibited.
      SECTION 5 . Judges may place Basset Hounds first, second, third and fourth, in each class, but full discretionary power is given to the Judges to withhold any or all awards for want of merit. After these places have been awarded the Judges may designate the next best qualified Hound as “N.B.Q.” N.B.Q. is not a place and, in case of disqualification of a placed Hound at a licensed or member trial, the N.B.Q. Hound shall not be moved up.
      SECTION 6 . Field Championship points for Basset Hounds shall be awarded only to Hounds placing in a licensed or member field trial in Open All-Age Classes in which there are six (6) or more starters and shall be awarded on the following basis:
      1	point to the winner of first place for each starter;
      1⁄2 point to the winner of second place for each starter; 1⁄4 point to the winner of third place for each starter; 1⁄8 point to the winner of fourth place for each starter.
      A starter is an entered eligible Hound that has not been disqualified and that has been cast or laid on a line with its bracemate at the start of its first series heat at a brace trial, or that has been cast at the start of its first series pack at a small pack trial; or that has been cast at the start with the rest of the pack at a large pack trial.
      SECTION 7 . Field Championship Requirements . In order to be recorded a Field Champion, a Basset Hound must be registered in The American Kennel Club Stud Book. The total number of wins, place- ments and points shall be established by the Board of Directors of The American Kennel Club.
      To be recorded a Field Champion, a Basset Hound must have won Championship points in Open All-Age Classes at eight (8) or more licensed or member Basset Hound Field Trials and must have won at least two (2) first places and sixty (60) points in such classes with not less than six (6) starters.
       
      A Field Champion may be designated as a “Dual Champion” if it has also been awarded the title of Champion. Any Basset Hound which has been awarded the titles of Champion of Record, Obedience Trial Champion and Field Champion may be designated as a “Triple Champion.”
      
      CHAPTER 10
      JUDGES’ BOOKS AND REPORTS
      SECTION 1 . At the conclusion of the judging of each class at a licensed or member field trial the club shall provide for the Judges’ signatures a book showing the class judged and the full particulars of each Hound placed at a brace trial or the number of each Hound placed at a pack trial. The Judges shall certify as to the number of actual starters, which shall not include any Hound that has been disqualified or that has been otherwise found to be ineligible. At the conclusion of the field trial the Field Trial Secretary shall verify the Judges’ signatures for the respective classes and shall also certify as to the number of Hounds drawn for a Brace or Small Pack trial or entered for a Large Pack trial and to the number of starters. At a trial run in small or large packs, he/she shall also certify as to the identity of each Hound according to its number. The Judges’ book and a full report of the trial shall be sent to The American Kennel Club in time to be received by them no later than seven (7) days after the closing date of the trial. Entry forms will be retained by the host club for 12 months in case questions arise. The penalty imposed for non-compliance will be twenty-five dollars ($25.00) plus an additional five dollars ($5.00) per day for each day’s delay beyond the deadline, and any other such penalties as may be imposed by the
      Board of Directors of The American Kennel Club.
      The report shall contain a list of the names of all members of the Field Trial Committee who were present at the trial, the names and complete addresses of all of the Judges and the name and address of the Field Trial Secretary.
      AKC will collect a $3.50 Event Service Fee for each entry of a dog in all AKC licensed and member Basset Hound field trials. At the present time, a Hound entered in a non-regular class or stake is exempt from the service fee. The AKC Board of Directors shall determine, from time to time, the amount of the event service fee.
       
      STANDARD PROCEDURES GENERAL PROCEDURES GOVERNING BASSET HOUND FIELD TRIALS RUN IN
      BRACES, SMALL PACKS AND LARGE PACKS
      All of these procedures shall apply to sanctioned field trials as well as to licensed or member field trials except for those procedures that state specifically that they apply to licensed or member trials.
      
      PROCEDURE 1. MANAGEMENT
      1-A	The Field Trial Committee shall have full charge of the organization and management of the trial and shall have the power, subject to the bylaws, rules and procedures of The American Kennel Club, to interpret any special rules published by the club holding the field trial and to decide any matter, whether arising from an unforeseen emergency or not, which is not specifically provided for in these rules and procedures. Whenever such matters arise, the Field Trial Committee shall exercise the specific powers and carry out the duties described in these rules and procedures and submit a complete report of the incident to The American Kennel Club.
      1-B	Each Club holding a licensed or member field trial must have at least three (3) members of the Field Trial Committee present on the grounds at all times during the running of the trial. If a split class or two classes are run at the same time on different running grounds there must be at least three members of the Field Trial Committee on each grounds throughout the running, unless the separate running grounds are immediately adjacent to each other. A club which fails to comply with this requirement will not be approved for a licensed or member field trial during the next field trial season.
      1-C	The Field Trial Committee shall appoint a Marshal or Marshals to carry out the orders of the Judges. Marshals may advise Judges but must carry out the instructions of the Judges whose decision is final. At a trial run in Large Packs, no person shall act as Marshal for a class in which he/she has a Hound entered and, at a trial run in Small Packs, no person shall act as Roving Marshal for a class in which he/she has a Hound entered. Marshals shall be identified by badges or arm bands carrying the designation “Marshal.”
      1-D	At a field trial run in Small Packs there shall be two Marshals. One Marshal shall guide and supervise the gallery. The other Marshal, known as the Roving Marshal, shall assist the Judges and supervise the handlers.
       
      1-E	At a trial run in Large Packs there shall be three or more Marshals. One of the Marshals shall assist Judges in becoming acquainted with the running grounds and act as a guide and liaison between the Judges, the other Marshals, the Field Trial Committee and the gallery. The other Marshals shall keep owners, handler and spectators out of the running grounds and report to the Judges immediately in writing any Hound that has pulled out of the running pack, together with the number, time, and length of time out of the pack. After the class is completed, one Marshal shall account for all Hounds and guide the handlers from the running grounds.
      1-F	At a field trial run under brace or small pack procedures each class or division of a class shall be judged by two Judges. At a field trial run in Large Packs there shall be at least two Judges for each class or division of a class. If substitute Judges are required, or if additional Judges are required for a split class, they may be appointed by the Field Trial Committee at the trial, provided they are persons in good standing with The American Kennel Club. When such Judges are used they should, if possible, act in conjunction with one or more of the advertised Judges provided this does not prevent any advertised Judge from completing the judging of a class which he has already started. If two such Judges have to judge together without one of the advertised Judges, at least one should be an experienced Judge of The American Kennel Club licensed Basset Hound or Beagle field trials. The American Kennel Club shall be notified promptly of additional or substitute Judges officiating.
      1-G	No licensed or member Basset Hound field trial may be run on released game unless the game has been released prior to the first day of the trial.
      1-H	Any advertising a club decides to use for a licensed or member trial shall include the following information which must be identical with the information approved by The American Kennel Club for the premium list copy: Names of approved Judges and the classes they are to judge; type of trial, whether Brace, Small Pack, or Large Pack; location of trial; date on which each class is to start; entry fee; the place where the drawing or numbering will be done and time entries close for each class.
      1-I	One person only may handle or hunt each Hound, whether it be the owner, or agent or the agent’s deputy. All others must remain in the gallery, except that at a licensed or member trial, one additional person may accompany each handler, with permission of the handler and of the Judges,
       
      but without permission of the other handler. At a sanctioned trial additional persons may follow the Hounds, except when the Judges or all handlers in a given Brace, Trio or Small Pack object.
      When game is raised or the Hounds are away on the trail, the gallery shall stand fast or change position only as instructed by the Judges or the Marshal.
      At trials run in Large Packs everyone except Judges and Marshals must go to an advantageous point designated by the Judges or Marshal and may change positions only at the discretion of the Judges or Marshal.
      1-J	If unforeseen circumstances make it impossible to complete the judging of a licensed or member field trial on the last date applied for and approved by The American Kennel Club, the Field Trial Committee may continue the judging on one or two days immediately following the last date approved. The Field Trial Secretary’s report to The American Kennel Club shall include a report of the circumstances requiring the extension and a list of the classes or series judged on each additional day.
      1-K	At a licensed or member trial run under Brace or Small Pack Procedures, no Hounds shall be put down after 30 minutes following official sunset. The Field Trial Committee and the Judges shall be responsible for enforcement of this Procedure.
      
      PROCEDURE 2. ENTRIES
      2-A	If any question should arise as to a different Hound having been substituted in place of the Hound described on the entry form, the question shall immediately be investigated by the Field Trial Committee, who shall decide whether or not the entered Hound has been run after giving all parties an opportunity to be heard, and submit a complete report of its findings and decision to The American Kennel Club.
      If the Field Trial Committee decides that a Hound other than the Hound entered and drawn has been run, both the entered Hound that did not run and the substituted Hound shall be disqualified. Entry fees and any awards shall be forfeited. However, if it can be shown that the substituted Hound was run by someone other than the owner or handler and without permission of the owner or handler, this Hound shall not be disqualified.
      If at a trial, a Brace or Trio or Small Pack of four becomes incomplete as the result of one or more Hounds  being  disqualified  under  this  procedure
       
      before the completion of judging of first series, the remaining Hound or Hounds retaining their same relative position to each other shall be moved down to a position immediately following the last Hound drawn. Beginning with the odd Hound or Hounds, if any were drawn, additional complete Braces or Trios or Small Packs of four shall be made up. If an incomplete Brace or Trio or Small Pack still remains, an additional Hound or Hounds needed to complete the Brace or Trio or Small Pack of four shall be selected by the Judges. Any previous scoring received by a Hound thus moved shall be canceled.
      2-B	Neutered dogs and spayed bitches are eligible for entry and shall be permitted to compete in Basset Hound field trials.
      2-C	In a class for combined sexes, any bitch which in the opinion of the Field Trial Committee is in season, shall be ineligible to compete and shall be excluded from the running grounds and regular kennels. A separate kennel shall be provided for such bitches.
      2-D	All entered Hounds must be present on the field trial grounds at the time entries close at a licensed or member trial, when entries close on the day the class is to be run.
      2-E	No Hound which is entered and present may be withheld from competition at any trial and no Hound may be withdrawn during the running of a class, unless it is disqualified by the Judges, or is found to be ineligible, or is excused by the Field Trial Committee after consultation with the Judges. No Hound will be excused by a Field Trial Committee except in the most unusual and deserving circumstances and never to meet the convenience or caprice of its owner or his agent. If any Hound should be withheld or withdrawn with or without the consent of the Field Trial Committee, that committee shall make a full report of the incident in writing and the report shall be forwarded to The American Kennel Club by the Field Trial Secretary.
      
      PROCEDURE 3. JUDGING
      3-A	All Judges prior to assuming their duties shall familiarize themselves with these rules and procedures and make their findings in accordance therewith. If any Judge shall fail to judge in accordance with these Procedures, the Field Trial Committee shall report the irregularity in detail to The American Kennel Club.
      3-B	No person shall make any remarks or give any information which might affect the actions of the
       
      persons handling the Hounds or the running of the Hounds. Any person so offending may be expelled from the running grounds on orders from the Judges and points of merit shall not be allowed any Hound whose handler acts upon such information. The Judges must be informed of any such misconduct before the close of the race in which it occurs and their decision shall be final.
      3-C	If a Hound under judgment wears a collar, it shall be a well-fitting collar with nothing hanging from it and with no attachments other than tags for identification purposes. Hounds may wear tracking collars at the option of the handler. The collar surface against the dog’s neck shall be flat (no protrusions). While the hounds are under judgement, hand-held devices must be turned off. Hand-held devices may be turned on only after the hound has been eliminated from competition by the judges or judgement has ceased. Special training devices that are used to control and train dogs, including but not limited to collars with prongs, electronic collars used with transmitters, muzzles and head collars may not be use on dogs at AKC events.
      3-D	The Judges shall not permit any person who is handling a Hound to make any unnecessary noise, or to conduct himself in a disorderly manner, or to interfere in any way with an opponent’s Hound. Judges shall report promptly to the Field Trial Committee for appropriate action, any person handling a Hound who, during the running of a class, fails or refuses to comply with the Judges’ orders, or who uses abusive language to a Judge or otherwise conducts himself in a manner prejudicial to the best interests of Hound field trials.
      
      PROCEDURE 4. JUDGING
      4-A	Foreword
      (1)	The Basset Hound is a trailing hound whose purpose is to find game, to pursue it in an energetic and decisive manner and to show a determination to account for it.
      (2)	All phases of its work should be approached eagerly, with a display of determination that indicates willingness to stay with any problem encountered until successful. Actions should appear deliberate and efficient, rather than haphazard or impulsive.
      (3)	To perform as desired, the Basset Hound must be endowed with a keen nose, a sound body and an intelligent mind and must have an intense enthusiasm for hunting.
      (4)	Basset Hound Field Trials are designed and
       
      conducted for the purpose of selecting those Hounds who display sound quality and ability to their best advantage.
      (5)	This Standard of Performance contains descriptions of both desirable and faulty actions. Judges will use it as a guide in evaluating performances and will credit or demerit performance to whatever degree their actions indicate quality or fault, and to the extent that these actions contribute to accomplishment, fail to contribute to accomplishment, or interfere with accomplishment.
      (6)	Judges should approach their work with the attitude that the future welfare of the breed is in their hands and should make their findings and selections on a basis calculated toward keeping the Basset Hound useful for both field trials and hunting purposes.
      
      4-B	Definitions — Desirable Qualities Searching ability is evidenced by an aptitude to
      recognize promising cover and an eagerness to explore it, regardless of hazards or discomfort. Hounds should search independently of each other, in an industrious manner, with sufficient range. In trials run under Brace or Small Pack Procedures, hounds should remain within control distance of the handler and should be obedient to his/her commands.
      Pursuing ability is shown by a proficiency for keeping control of the trail while making the best possible progress. Game should be pursued rather than merely followed and actions should indicate a determined effort to make forward progress in the surest, most sensible manner by adjusting speed to correspond to conditions and circumstances. Actions should be positive and controlled, portraying sound judgment and skill. Progress should be proclaimed by tonguing. No Hound can be too fast, provided the trail is clearly and accurately followed. At a check, Hounds should work industriously, first close to where the loss occurred, then gradually and thoroughly extending the search further afield to regain the line.
      Accuracy in trailing is the ability to keep consistent control of the trail while making the best possible progress. An accurate trailing Hound will show a marked tendency to follow the trail with a minimum of weaving on and off and will display an aptness to turn with the trail and to determine direction of game travel in a positive manner.
      Proper use of voice is proclaiming all finds and denoting all forward progress by giving tongue, yet keeping silent when not in contact with scent that can be progressed. True tongue is honest claiming that running mates can depend on.
       
      Endurance is the ability to compete throughout the duration of the hunt and to go on as long as may be necessary.
      Adaptability means being able to adjust quickly to changes in scenting conditions and being able to work harmoniously with a variety of running mates. An adaptable Hound will pursue its quarry as fast as conditions permit or as slowly as conditions demand. At a loss, it will first work close, and then, if necessary, move out gradually to recover the line.
      Patience is a willingness to stay with any problem encountered as long as there is a possibility of achieving success in a workmanlike manner, rather than taking a chance of making the recovery more quickly through guesswork or gambling. Patience keeps a Hound from bounding off and leaving work undone and causes it to apply itself to the surest and safest methods in difficult situations.
      Determination is that quality which causes a Hound to succeed against severe odds. A determined Hound has a purpose in mind and will overcome, through sheer perseverance, many obstacles that often frustrate less determined running mates. Determination and patience are closely related qualities and are generally found in the same Hound. Determination keeps a Hound at its work as long as there is a possibility of achievement and quite often long after its body has passed the peak of its endurance. Determination is desire in its most intense form.
      Independence is the ability to be self-reliant and to refrain from becoming upset or influenced by the actions of faulty Hounds. The proper degree of independence is displayed by the Hound that concentrates on running its game with no undue concern for its running mates except to hark to them when they proclaim a find or indicate progress by tonguing. Tailing, or watching other Hounds, is indication of lack of sufficient independence. Ignoring other Hounds completely and refusing to hark to or move up with running mates is an indication of too much independence.
      Cooperation is the ability to work harmoniously with other Hounds by doing as much of the work as possible in an honest, efficient manner, yet being aware of and honoring the accomplishments of running mates without jealousy or disruption of the chase.
      Competitive spirit is the desire to outdo running mates. It is a borderline quality that is an asset only to the Hound that is able to keep it under control
       
      and to concentrate on running the game rather than on beating other Hounds. The overly competitive Hound lacks such qualities as adaptability, patience, independence, and cooperation and, in its desire to excel, is seldom accurate.
      Intelligence is that quality which influences a Hound to apply its talents efficiently, in the manner of a skilled craftsman. The intelligent Hound learns from experience and seldom wastes time repeating mistakes. Intelligence is indicated by an ability to adapt to changes in scenting conditions, to adapt and to control its work with various types of running mates, and to apply sound working principles toward accomplishing the most under a variety of circumstances.
      The Hound that displays the aforementioned qualities would be considered the Ideal Hound for all purposes afield, capable of serving as a field trial hound, a gun dog, or a member of a pack, on either rabbit or hare.
      
      4-C	Definitions — Faulty Actions Quitting is a serious fault deserving severe penalty
      and, in its extreme form, elimination. Quitting indicates lack of desire to hunt and succeed. It ranges from refusing to run, to such lesser forms as lack of perseverance, occasional letup of eagerness, and loafing or watching other Hounds in difficult situations. Quitting is sometimes due to fatigue. Judges may temper their distaste when a Hound becomes fatigued and eases off if such a Hound has been required to perform substantially longer than those with which it is running. During the running of a class, a Hound may have to face several fresh competitors in succession. In such instances a short rest period would be in order. Otherwise, Judges should expect Hounds to be in condition to compete as long as necessary to prove their worthiness and no Hound who becomes unable to go on should place over any immediate running mate that is still able and willing to run.
      Backtracking is the fault of following the trail in the wrong direction. If persisted in for any substantial time or distance it deserves elimination. However, Hounds in competition sometimes take a back-line momentarily or are led into it by faulty running mates. Under these circumstances Judges should show lenience toward the Hound that becomes aware of its mistakes and makes a creditable correction. Judges should be very certain before penalizing a Hound for backtracking and, if there is any doubt, take sufficient time to prove it to be either right or wrong.
       
      Backtracking indicates lack of ability to determine direction of game travel.
      Ghost trailing is pretending to have contact with a trail and making progress where no trail exists, by going through all the actions that indicate true trailing. Some Hounds are able to do this in a very convincing manner and Judges, if suspicious, should make the Hound prove its claim.
      Pottering is the lack of effort or desire to make forward progress on the trail. Hesitating, listlessness, dawdling, or lack of intent to make progress are marks of the potterer.
      Babbling is excessive or unnecessary tonguing. The babbler often tongues the same trail over and over, or tongues from excitement when casting, in an attempt to regain the trail at losses.
      Swinging is casting out too far and too soon from the last point of contact, without first making an attempt to regain scent near the loss. It is a gambling action, quite often indicating over-competitiveness or an attempt to gain unearned advantage over running mates.
      Skirting is purposely leaving the trail in an attempt to gain a lead or avoid hazardous cover or hard work. It is cutting out and around true trailing mates in an attempt to intercept the trail ahead.
      Leaving checks is failure to stay in the vicinity of a loss and attempt to work it out, bounding off in hopes of encountering the trail or new game. Leaving checks denotes lack of patience and perseverance.
      Running mute is failure to give tongue when making progress on the line.
      Tightness of mouth is a failure to give sufficient tongue when making progress. This will often be evidenced by the Hound tightening up when pressed or when going away from a check.
      Racing is attempting to outfoot running mates without regard for the trail. Racing Hounds overshoot the turns and generally spend more time off the trail than on it.
      Running hit or miss is attempting to make progress without maintaining continuous contact with the trail or gambling to hit the trail ahead.
      Lack of independence is a common fault that is shown by watching other Hounds and allowing them to determine the course of action. Any action which indicates undue concern for other Hounds, except when harking in, is cause for demerit.
      Bounding off is rushing ahead when contact with scent is made, without properly determining direction of game travel.
       
      4-D	— Credits
      (1)	Hounds shall be credited principally for their positive accomplishments. The extent of any credit should be governed by the magnitude of the accomplishment and the manner in which it is achieved. Credit is earned for searching ability, pursuing ability, accuracy in trailing, proper use of voice, endurance, adaptability, patience, determination, proper degree of independence, cooperation, controlled competitive spirit, intelligence displayed when searching or in solving problems encountered along the trail, and success in accounting for game.
      (2)	When crediting Hounds for working style or methods used to gain accomplishments, Judges should keep the purpose of the breed constantly in mind and be alert for Hounds, deficient in ability, that make simple problems appear difficult. They should also guard against becoming impressed by fascinating actions that do not produce results. Credit for working style should be used chiefly to differentiate between successful performers and should never be applied to a degree which might indicate that style or method has been preferred to accomplishment, except in instances where excessive faultiness is involved. Credit for any accomplishment should be in proportion to its contribution to the performance. Mere lack of fault is not grounds for credit. While faultiness is not to be considered lightly, the slightly faulty Hound that succeeds should be preferred to the stylist that fails.
      
      4-E— Demerits
      (1)	Faults, mistakes, lack of accomplishment, and apparent lack of intelligence, shall be considered demerits and shall be penalized to whatever extent they interfere with or fail to contribute to a performance.
      (2)	Faults are undesirable traits indicating lack of sound quality and shall be penalized in proportion to the degree of commitment, the frequency of repetition, and the distractions they afford running mates, as well as for the interruptions or lack of progress they cause during the performance. Quitting, backtracking, ghost trailing, and running mute are the more serious faults. Pottering, swinging, skirting, babbling, leaving checks, racing, running in hit-or-miss fashion, tightness of mouth and lack of desire or ability to find and move game shall be considered demerits.
      (3)	Mistakes are erratic judgements, sometimes committed under pressure of competition and prompted by a desire to excel and sometimes due to the influence of faulty running mates. Where mistakes
       
      are not committed with frequency that would indicate lack of sound quality, consideration should be shown according to the Hound’s aptitude for realizing its errors and its efforts to overcome them.
      (4)	Lack of accomplishment is failure to get enough done to compare favorably with the competition and is often due to lack of such qualities as determination, patience, intelligence, or endurance. In instances where this is apparent, the penalty should be severe. Judgement on Hounds that fail to accomplish as desired should be based on the circumstances under which the failure occurred and the determination and intelligence displayed in the effort to overcome it. Where the failure is no fault of the Hound, such as interference with the game or trail, or where a worthy Hound encounters an especially hazardous or abnormal circumstance unlike anything the majority of contestants are expected to overcome, new game should be provided without penalty. Lack of intelligence is apparent in the Hound that does not portray sound judgment and skill during its performance.
       
      ADDITIONAL STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR BASSET HOUND FIELD TRIALS RUN IN BRACES ON RABBIT OR HARE
      
      PROCEDURE 5. CLOSING, DRAWING, BRACING ABSENTEES
      5-A	Immediately prior to the closing of entries for each class at a licensed or member field trial, the Field Trial Secretary shall announce any necessary changes in Judges or other decisions by the Field Trial Committee affecting the running of the class. The Field Trial Secretary shall then call out the names of all Hounds entered in that class, after which he/she shall announce that entries have closed and that the drawing will begin.
      5-B	The running order of the Hounds entered in each class shall be determined by drawing and the Hounds shall be drawn in Braces, or Trios if applicable, for the first series. Should a second Hound owned by the same person be drawn in the same Brace or Trio, that Hound will change places with the next Hound drawn which is not so owned. This change will be made with a Hound drawn later if possible, but may be made with a Hound drawn earlier if necessary. The running together of two or three such Hounds may be permitted in the first series when a separation is impos- sible, but in no other case.
      5-C	The Field Trial Committee shall have the option of splitting a class in which there are fifty (50) or more entries into two divisions, A and B, except that at a licensed or member field trial, no class may be split on any day on which the club has scheduled the start of more than one class. If a class is to be split, the Judges and running grounds for each division shall be assigned by the Field Trial Committee and announced before the drawing is started. The entire class shall be drawn as one, the first half of the class as drawn constituting Division A, and the second half as drawn constituting Division B. There shall be the same number of Hounds in each Division, except that any odd brace shall be added to Division A and any odd Hound shall be added to Division B. At least one advertised Judge must officiate in each Division if possible. After the first series, an equal number of Hounds shall be brought back from each Division. In the case of a sanctioned trial, provided any announcement or advertising for the event so states, second and subsequent series may be run in accord with the Procedures for Small Pack trials, but otherwise, second and subsequent series shall be run in Braces. The high Hounds from both Divisions shall
       
      be the first brace in the second series, the other braces being similarly made up of one Hound from each Division in the order in which each was scored in first series. The two Hounds in each second series Brace shall start equal. The second and subsequent series shall be judged by the advertised Judges, if possible.
      At licensed or member trials run under the procedures for Brace trials, if there are thirty (30) or more entries in a class, the Field Trial Committee shall also have the option of running the first series in the class in Trios (3 at a time) instead of Braces (2 at a time). A club is not required to advertise whether it will exercise this option.
      At sanctioned trials run under the procedures for Brace trials, the first series may be run in Trios regardless of the entry, provided the trials are so advertised.
      5-D	The additional Hound or Hounds needed to complete an incomplete Brace or Trio in first series shall be selected by the Judges.
      5-E	Owners and handlers must keep themselves informed as to the running order and progress of the judging and must be ready within hailing distance when their Hounds are called by the Marshal on instructions from the Judges.
      The running order cannot be changed under any circumstances once the Hounds have been drawn, except as specifically provided in Procedures 2-A and 5-F.
      5-F	Any Hound, except the additional Hound or Hounds called to complete an incomplete Brace or Trio in first series, that does not appear within 15 minutes after the Judges have called for its Brace, Trio or Small Pack shall be marked absent in any series and shall not be permitted to run. Its absence shall be reported by the Judges to the Field Trial Committee, which shall investigate the absence and submit a complete report to The American Kennel Club. If, in first series, a Brace or Trio becomes incomplete as the result of one or more Hounds being “clocked out” under this procedure, the remaining Hound or Hounds, retaining their same relative position to each other, shall be moved down to a position immediately following the last Hound drawn. Then, beginning with the odd Hound or Hounds if any were drawn, additional complete Braces or Trios shall be made up. If an incomplete Brace or Trio still remains, an additional Hound or Hounds needed to complete the Brace or Trio shall be selected by the Judges.
      If a Hound is absent after the Braces have been announced in second or subsequent series, the remaining Hounds shall be moved up and each Hound
       
      below the absent Hound shall be braced with the next highest Hound with whom it has not been previously braced. The Judges shall establish a reasonable time before disqualifying for absence the Hound or Hounds they have selected to complete an incomplete Brace or Trio in first series.
      
      PROCEDURE 6. INSTRUCTIONS TO JUDGES
      6-A	Whenever practicable the Hounds shall be cast to search for game, but the decision as to whether the Hounds are to be cast or whether they are to be kept on leash until they are laid on a line where game has been sighted, shall be made by the Judges alone.
      6-B	Each heat shall be conducted in a manner best calculated to give the competitors equal opportunity to display the qualities under judgment. No Hound shall be started except as part of a complete Brace or Trio at the start of a Brace or Trio in first series or without a bracemate at the start of a Brace in second and subsequent series.  The Judges shall establish a reasonable time before dropping a Hound that is missing after the start of a Brace or Trio. The Hound or Hounds called to complete a Brace or Trio in any series shall be under judgment. Any previous scoring received by such additional Hound or Hounds shall be canceled.
      When running a Brace in any series, if a Hound attacks its bracemate in a manner which, in the opinion of the Judges, renders it impossible for the non-offending Hound to perform properly, the Judges shall order up the offender and run the non-offending Hound until they are satisfied, calling for an additional rabbit or rabbits if required.
      A Marshal may be appointed by the Field Trial Committee to accompany the Judges to assist them in picking up any Hound that has been ordered out of the Trio.
      When the Hounds are running in Trios, the Judges may order out of the Trio any one Hound (but not more than one) which, in their opinion, is found to disorganize the smooth running of the Trio.
      If at the start of a Brace or Trio, one or two of the Hounds refuse to run or, if at any time before the completion of the judging of a Brace or Trio, one or two of the Hounds become lost or quit, the Judges shall continue to run the remaining Hound or Hounds until they are satisfied, calling for an additional rabbit or rabbits, if required.
      6-C	When a Hound gives signs of being on game, the Judges shall allow it the opportunity to prove whether or not it is on true trail. Judges shall not penalize or fault a Hound without ample proof.  If
       
      reasonable doubt exists, the Hound shall be given the benefit of the doubt.
      6-D	When the Hounds have been laid on a line together or have been given an opportunity to hark in to one another in any series, this shall be considered as competition, except that when no Hound opens, the Brace or Trio shall be given a second rabbit or hare unless the first rabbit or hare was seen by one of the Judges.
      6-E	Trailing game other than announced, such as pheasants or game animals, shall not be considered a demerit.
      6-F	Should a Brace or Trio become divided, the Hounds going away on different rabbits or hares, the Judges shall order all Hounds up and the Brace or Trio shall be put on game different from that previously run by any of the Hounds.
      6-G	Judges shall not eliminate a Hound in any series for the sole reason of losing game.
      6-H	When additional game is required, the search shall start at the point where the last game was found.
      6-I	After the running of first series has been completed, the Judges shall announce which Hounds they wish to see in second series and no other Hounds shall be called to run in second series following this announcement, except in the case of an error by the Judges in identification of a Hound. In the case of a sanctioned trial, provided any announcement or advertising for the event so states, second and subsequent series may be run in accord with the Procedures for Small Pack trial, but otherwise, second and subsequent series shall be run in Braces. In bracing the Hounds in second and subsequent series, the Hound having the highest score from first series must be announced as the first Hound in the first Brace, and its bracemate shall be the next highest scored Hound which has not been braced with it in first series. The remaining braces in second series shall be braced in the same manner. No two Hounds shall be braced together if they have run in the same Brace or Trio in an earlier series.
      6-J	All Hounds called for second series shall be considered as having an opportunity to win or place regardless of their relative positions when called back, except that no Hound shall be placed higher than another placed Hound by which it has previously been defeated in direct competition during the running of the class. In deciding whether one Hound has defeated another in direct competition in second or subsequent series, the scoring of the two Hounds in earlier series shall not be considered. After first series,
       
      the Judges shall run each Brace until one Hound, in their opinion, has clearly defeated the other, unless both Hounds are so faulty as not to merit further consideration for placement. If required, additional rabbits may be given at the Judges’ discretion.
      6-K	The Judges may announce the four placed Hounds at any time after completion of second series, provided each placed Hound has been defeated in direct competition by the Hound placed immediately above it. All placed Hounds must have run in second series. No series or any part of any series shall be rerun, except for any part of a series which may have been affected by an error made by the Judges in bracing or in identification of a Hound, and except further that the Judges may continue the running of a Brace at a later time or on the following day if darkness or severe weather conditions make it necessary to pick up the Hounds before the judging of that Brace is completed.
      6-L	The Judges must agree on the scoring of each Hound before starting the next Brace or Trio.
      6-M	Should there arise at any time during the running of a heat a question concerning the actual running of the Hounds that is not provided for in these Procedures, the Judges shall handle the situation in a manner not contrary to these Procedures and shall so decide the matter as to give each Hound an equal opportunity.
      6-N	No owner or handler shall have any right to question or refuse to follow the Judges’ orders.
      6-O	Handlers, while their Hounds are down, shall go together and keep within sight of the Judges and each other when possible. When Hounds are cast, a handler may speak or whistle to his Hound or work it any way he may deem proper, if not contrary to these Procedures, but he shall not make any unnecessary noise, nor interfere with an opponent’s Hound in any way. When Hounds have been laid on a line together or have harked in to one another, the duties of the handlers shall cease until further instructed by the Judges.
      The handlers shall at all times keep back of the Judges and Basset Hounds unless otherwise instructed by the Judges. Judges shall enforce these requirements at all times.
       
      ADDITIONAL STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR THE BASSET HOUND FIELD TRIALS
      RUN IN SMALL PACKS ON RABBIT OR HARE
      PROCEDURE 7. DRAWING, MARKING AND RUNNING
      7-A	All of the procedures governing Basset Hound field trials run in Braces and Basset Hound field trials run in Large Packs shall, to the extent that they are applicable and not in conflict with the following procedures, also govern Basset Hound field trials run in Small Packs on Rabbit or Hare.
      7-B	The Hounds shall be numbered consecutively as entered, starting with the number “1.” Each Hound shall have its number painted on both its sides with a durable paint, the figures to be at least 31 ⁄2 inches high and clearly visible. The Field Trial Secretary and his assistant, if any, shall be the only persons to record each number against the name of the corresponding Hound. These numbers shall be used in the drawing and running of the packs and the names of the Hounds must not be used. Alternatively, for Small Pack Field Trials hounds may wear color coded collars. The colors to be used are Red, White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Pink, Silver or Black.
      7-C	The packs in first and subsequent series, except the Winners Pack, shall consist of four to seven Hounds, except that when the class has only eight or nine Hounds they may be run in one pack. The Field Trial Committee shall decide how the class will be divided in first and second series, the number of packs and the number of Hounds in each pack. The packs shall be drawn for in first and second series. The Hounds shall be run in packs as drawn regardless of ownership and the packs must be run in the order drawn. If there is a third series, other than the Winners Pack, the Judges shall decide and announce in the field, the number of packs and the number of Hounds in each pack. The Judges shall arrange the Hounds in numerical order in packs in third series.
      7-D	Whenever practicable, the Hounds shall be cast to search for game, but the decision as to whether the Hounds are to be cast or whether they are to be kept on leash until they are laid on a line where game has been sighted, shall be made by the Judges alone unless the club chooses to advertise that the Hounds shall be cast to search for game. Handlers will control the Hounds in the search for game and will get the Hounds in the pack when game is started. After game is started handlers will have five minutes in which to get Hounds in the pack unless one or more Hounds are running another rabbit. In such case, or in case of a split pack, the Roving Marshal will instruct, advise,
       
      and assist the handlers in getting the Hounds running together as a pack.
      7-E	This procedure shall apply to the running of all packs and to all series except Winners Pack.
      (1)	Judges may select all, any, or none of the Hounds from each pack for further running.
      (2)	The Judges may run any pack for as long a time as they deem necessary in order to select the Hounds to be considered for the next series.
      (3)	At any time during the running of a pack the Judges shall order up any faulty Hound that is interfering with the smooth running of the pack and shall also order up any Hound whose performance does not merit further consideration.
      (4)	Hounds to be eliminated shall be ordered up one or two at a time until all are eliminated or only those to be considered for the next series remain in the pack.
      (5)	If there appear to be no worthy Hounds in a pack, they shall be gradually eliminated by ordering up the most faulty Hounds as such are determined one or two at a time down to the last Hound, if necessary, to make sure no worthy Hound is overlooked before the entire pack is eliminated.
      (6)	When the Judges have seen enough and those Hounds, if any, which are being considered for next series have been selected, the pack shall be ordered up. 7-F After the running of all packs in each series, the Judges shall submit to the Roving Marshal or Field Trial Secretary a list of the numbers of the Hounds to
      be called back for the next series.
      7-G Hounds selected for succeeding series shall not be rated but shall enter each series equally rated.
      7-H When the class has been reduced to five to nine Hounds by running sufficient series to accomplish this end, the remaining Hounds shall be run as a pack and will be known as the Winners Pack.
      (1)	When running the Winners Pack, Judges shall order up one or two Hounds at a time beginning with the lowest-rated Hound and working up to the top two Hounds.
      (2)	The two top-rated Hounds must be run as a Brace until the Judges are sure which is the top Hound. The performance of each Hound during the entire running of the Winners Pack will be considered in selecting the top Hound, but Judges must run them until they are sure which Hound can continue to out perform the other.
      (3)	After Judges have completed the running of the Winners Pack and have decided on the placing of the Hounds, they shall submit to the Roving Marshal or Field Trial Secretary a list of the numbers of the Hounds as placed and N.B.Q.
       
      ADDITIONAL STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR BASSET HOUND FIELD TRIALS RUN IN LARGE PACKS ON HARE
      
      PROCEDURE 8. MARKING AND DRAWING
      8-A	The Hounds shall be numbered as entered, starting with the number “ 1.” Each Hound shall have its number painted on both its sides with a durable paint, the figures to be at least 31⁄2 inches high and clearly visible. The Field Trial Secretary and his assistant, if any, shall be the only persons to record each number against the name of the corresponding Hound. These numbers shall be used in any drawing and in the running of the packs and the names of the Hounds must not be used. Alternatively, for Large Pack Field Trials hounds may wear color coded collars. The colors to be used are Red, White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Pink, Silver or Black.
      8-B	All entries in a class shall run as a pack; except that when there are more than twenty-five
      (25) starters, the pack may, at the option of the Field Trial Chairman, be split and the two Divisions run simultaneously for not less than two hours, with at least one advertised Judge with each pack if possible. If the Field Trial Chairman decides to split the pack, the Hounds shall be drawn so that their handlers will not have a choice of Judges or running grounds. The first half as drawn shall constitute Division A, and the remainder of the class including any odd Hounds shall constitute Division B. An equal number of Hounds from each pack will then run together for not less than one hour under all officiating Judges.
      In case of an entry of over twenty-five (25) Hounds in a class, the Field Trial Committee shall also have the following option: if the entry in the class is over twenty- five (25), the class may be split into two divisions; if the entry is over fifty (50), the class may be split into 3 divisions; if the entry is over seventy-five (75), the class may be split into 4 divisions. The divisions will be known as Qualifying Packs. The Qualifying Packs shall be drawn for, with an odd Hound to go in the last pack or, if there are two or three extra Hounds, with an odd Hound in each of the last two or three packs.
      The Qualifying Packs will run in the order drawn, each subsequent pack to be cast as the previous Pack has been ordered up.
      Judges will select from each Qualifying Pack only Hounds that merit possible further consideration.
      In Open Classes, Qualifying Packs shall run for not less than one (1) hour, and Derbies shall run for not less than 3⁄ of an hour.
       
      Hounds selected for Winners Pack shall not be rated but shall enter Winners Pack equally rated.
      Winners Pack shall run under Large Pack Procedures, but must run at least two (2) hours in Open Classes or one (1) hour for Derbies.
      At trials run under this option, all packs shall be judged by the advertised Judges, if possible.
      The Judges shall establish and announce a reasonable time before disqualifying a Hound called for its pack.
      A club is not required to advertise which option it will exercise if there are more than twenty-five (25) starters.
      
      PROCEDURE 9. INSTRUCTIONS TO JUDGES
      9-A	In Open Classes the pack shall run for not less than three (3) hours, and Derbies shall run for not less than one and one-half (11⁄ ) hours, subject to the exceptions contained in Procedures 8-B, 9-O, 9-P and 9-Q.
      9-B	Before each class the Judges shall agree upon a uniform point system of crediting and demeriting Hounds and shall inform the Chairman of the Field Trial Committee of the system they are going to use and he in turn shall inform the handlers of this system. 9-C All Judges must confer and agree on those Hounds eligible for first place and further must agree
      on all Hounds to be picked up under Procedure 9-R.
      9-D Should there arise at any time during the running of a class, questions bearing upon the actual running of the Hounds that are not provided for in these Procedures, the Judges are instructed to seek advice from the Field Trial Committee and so decide the matter as to give each Hound an equal opportunity. 9-E Each class shall be conducted in the manner best calculated to give every competitor an opportunity to display the qualities under judgment. The Judges shall allow each owner or handler the right and privilege to see his/her entry has a fair start and is fairly started on the line of scent with the balance of
      the pack at the beginning of each race.
      9-F	Should the pack split, Hounds going away on different hares, the Judges shall order the Marshals to order and assist the handlers to get their Hounds and get a new start on fresh game. If too many splits occur in one locality, all Hounds shall be ordered up and moved to a different location for a new start.
      9-G	After a class has been ordered up, all handlers shall have thirty (30) minutes in which to group their Hounds. All Hounds in the handlers’ possession after this thirty (30) minutes may then be cast. Handlers
       
      of missing Hounds shall then be allowed thirty (30) minutes after fresh game has been started to get their Hounds back into the pack.
      9-H	Judges are to consider that the Basset Hound is primarily a hunting hound and that its object is first to find game and second to drive it in an energetic and decisive manner and show an animated desire to overtake it.
      9-I	Trailing game other than announced shall not be considered a demerit, nor shall any Hound be demerited for failing to pack if the pack shall be proven to be on game other than announced. In the event such Hound shall be ordered up under Procedure 9-R it shall be reinstated in the pack.
      9-J	The number of times a Hound finds game shall not necessarily give it the preference, but the quality of the performance shall be given first consideration. Ability and desire to hunt are of first importance. These points are evidenced by intelligence, the method of working ground, and the ambition and industry displayed whether game is found or not.
      9-K	When a Hound gives signs of being on game, the Judges shall allow it the opportunity to prove whether or not it is on true trail. Judges shall not penalize or fault a Hound without ample proof. If reasonable doubt exists, the Hound shall be given the benefit of the doubt.
      9-L	The Judges shall give credit to the Hound that is a better searcher and sticks to its work. A Hound will be expected to maintain an efficient range throughout a race and to show hunting sense in its work. Hunting sense is shown by the desire to hunt for game, the selection of likely places to hunt in, the method of hunting the places, the industry in staying out at work, and the skill in handling and trailing the game after it is found.
      9-M	At a check all Hounds should work industriously, close to where the loss occurred, before going further afield to look for the line.
      9-N	Undue credit shall not be given a Hound with an outstanding voice, when not seen by the Judges, nor for speed nor flashy drive if the trail is not clearly followed. Accuracy in trailing, proper use of mouth, endurance, good pack qualities should be the principal points of merit.
      9-O	When a hare pursued by the pack runs into the gallery, cars or trains, or any such unforeseen obstacle and the Hounds come to a complete loss, the Judges shall then have all Hounds picked up and get a new start. The time the pack was down in the first race prior to the move shall be added to the time
       
      after the second start is made to determine when the scheduled time has elapsed. If it is necessary to order up the Hounds on the first day due to unavoidable circumstances such as darkness, a severe storm, or lack of game, when the pack has run less than two and one-half (21⁄ ) hours in an Open class or less than one (1) hour in a Derby, the same Hounds must be put down again to run the balance of the required time under the same Judges, either on the same day or on the following day; otherwise there shall be no championship points awarded.
      9-P	If no scoring is obtained on the first day, or if different Judges shall be used on the second day, then the class shall be considered as a continuation and shall be run for the full time, but the points shall be awarded on the basis of the number of starters the first day. Any Hound being withdrawn from the second day run must be reported to the Judges by the handler of the Hound, but in no case shall an entry fee be refunded as the opportunity to compete is still present. In the event that less than five (5) Hounds are on hand for the second day’s class, the class shall be declared no contest.
      9-Q	If the Judges require more time in order to make a satisfactory decision in the class, the Hounds must remain down until the Judges order them up, but in no case, unless all the Hounds “quit cold” can scheduled time be curtailed. Time is not to count if the pack gets on game other than hare.
      9-R	The Judges must order out of the race any Hound which in their opinion is found to disorganize the smooth running of the pack, such as cutting in front of a pack, backtracking, overrunning and giving tongue, stealing a line, ghost trailing, running mute, rioting, failing to pack, pulling out of the race and failing to get back in while the pack is in hearing. This procedure must be strictly adhered to. Pottering, swinging wide, skirting, babbling, leaving checks, racing, running in hit-or-miss style shall be considered faults and demerited, or if sufficiently serious the Hound may be ordered up.
      9-S	The Judges at the conclusion of approximately two (2) hours of running time may, at their discretion, order up any or all Hounds on which they have little or no score and continue for the final period of time judging only those Hounds on which they have scored and in no case shall a running pack be broken up to eliminate these Hounds.
      9-T	The placings of the Hounds shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the Field Trial Headquarters within one (1) hour after the close of the race.
       
      9-U	Owners and handlers shall not talk to the Judges from the time the pack is started until the judging of the pack is completed.
      9-V	When Hounds have been laid on a line or have harked in to one another, the duties of the handlers shall cease until further instructions are received from the Judges or the Marshals.
      9-W	Immediately after the Judges have ordered the Hounds up, they shall consult with the Marshals after which they shall meet and decide among themselves which Hounds are the winners. The results are to be given to the Field Marshal in writing who in turn will hand them over to the Field Trial Secretary who will check the numbers against the names and announce the winners.
      9-X	The Judges shall appoint a spokesperson from their number and all orders or information concerning the running of the class shall be given by him/her in a clear and impartial manner, so that each person handling a Hound may be fully informed.
      
      SANCTIONED BASSET HOUND FIELD TRIALS
      Any club that holds American Kennel Club events must obtain sanction for any type of field trial that is advertised to, or open to entries from, non-members of the Club.
      Sanctioned Basset Hound Field Trials are trials sanctioned by and run under the Rules and Procedures of The American Kennel Club at which NO CHAMPIONSHIP POINTS ARE AWARDED (See
      Chapter 3, Section 5).
      A PLAN “A” SANCTIONED BASSET HOUND
      FIELD TRIAL is a qualifying trial held by a club that wishes to qualify for the holding of its first licensed trial. Such a club will receive approval to hold a Plan A trial only if AKC is satisfied that the club will shortly be fully equipped and ready to hold a licensed trial which will be a credit to the sport. A Plan A trial is an important event and shall be conducted in accordance with all of the rules and procedures that apply to licensed or member trials, except those rules relating to championship points and except further that both sexes may be combined in a single class. The club is required to prepare regular premium lists and entry forms for the trial and to submit to The American Kennel Club after the trial all of the records described in Chapter 10, Section 1. Additionally, at least two Plan A trials must be held, at least six months apart, with a minimum of ten (10) Hounds entered and run in each class, if a club is to become eligible to submit an application for its first licensed trial.
       
      A PLAN “B” SANCTIONED BASSET HOUND
      FIELD TRIAL is any other type of sanctioned field trial held by a club or Basset Hound association. It may be a one-day event or may continue for two or more days. No premium list is required and the club does not have to submit records of the trial to The American Kennel Club.
      Applications for sanctioned Basset Hound field trials should be filed with The American Kennel Club at least FOUR WEEKS before the first day of the event applied for.
      
      INFORMATION FOR NEW BASSET HOUND CLUBS
      Any new club or persons considering forming a new club should contact the AKC Club Relations Department for assistance – ClubRelations@akc.org. A new club is expected to have a good number of members who reside within a reasonable distance of the club’s central location. Club Relations will assist the club in developing a democratic set of by-laws. Membership should be open to any person in good standing residing in the area who is interested in the sport. The area in which its members reside should not conflict with those of another Basset Hound field trial club.
